        <p class="profiledescribe">Environmental biology is similar to ecology. But while both fields study ecosystems, environmental biology places more emphasis on the biological aspect. Also, while ecology often focuses on the interactions between species in the same ecosystem, environmental biology focuses on the impacts of human activities on those ecosystems and the species living in them.</p>

        <p class="profiledescribe">At about the time he was growing dissatisfied with the direction biotechnology was taking, he discovered permaculture. A career change followed, and Hemenway and his wife, Kiel, spent ten years creating a rural permaculture site in southern Oregon. He was the editor of Permaculture Activist, a journal of ecological design and sustainable culture, from 1999 to 2004.</p>

        <div>
            <center class="perma-describe">
                <p>Permaculture is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of landscape and people â€” providing their food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way. Without permanent agriculture there is no possibility of a stable social order.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The philosophy behind permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless action; of looking at systems in all their functions, rather than asking only one yield of them; and allowing systems to demonstrate their own evolutions.</p>
