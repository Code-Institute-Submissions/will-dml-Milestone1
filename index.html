        <div id="perma-describe">
            <p>Permaculture is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of landscape and people â€” providing their food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way. Without permanent agriculture there is no possibility of a stable social order.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The philosophy behind permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless action; of looking at systems in all their functions, rather than asking only one yield of them; and allowing systems to demonstrate their own evolutions.</p>

           <div id="our-workshop">
            <p>In our workshop, we usually start by having a traditionnal "tour" of our garden. We will talk about the different plants that are growing here, learning what they are good for, how do they associate with the ones around them, how do they communicate.After a little bit of theory, we then look at the seasonal schedule to see what is needed to be done or seen at this momment. Every workshop has also is own little project! Like building a shelter for bats, or building a worm compost. And to finish, we are cooking together, get to know each other; what are our visions, share ideas about a how to live together and not against our environment. Oftenly, you also get to come back home with a box of vegetables!
